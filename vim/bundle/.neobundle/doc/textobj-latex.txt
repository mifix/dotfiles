INTRODUCTION					*textobj-latex-introduction*

This plugin provides text objects for common LaTeX stuff that are not
conveniently described by builtin Vim |text-objects|.


INSTALLATION					*textobj-latex-installation*

Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later
- Kana's |textobj-user| plugin, available at
  https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user

If you use |Vundle|, add the following lines to your |vimrc|:
>
	Bundle 'kana/vim-textobj-user'
	Bundle 'rbonvall/vim-textobj-latex'
<
and then run |:BundleInstall| from within |Vim|.

If you use |Pathogen|, clone both repos in your bundle directory:
>
	cd ~/.vim/bundle
	git clone git://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user
	git clone git://github.com/rbonvall/vim-textobj-latex
<
If you don't use either: you should.

I have included dependency information for Vim Addon Manager and Vim Flavor,
but have made no effort whatsoever to test if they work properly.


LATEX TEXT OBJECTS				*textobj-latex-text-objects*

Currently supported text objects come in pairs. The a-textobjs include its
delimiters, while the i-textobjs don't, just like many of the builtin Vim
text objects.

						*textobj-latex-paren-equation*
a\						*textobj-latex-a\*
i\						*textobj-latex-i\*
			Text objects for inline math surrounded by \( and \).

						*textobj-latex-dollar-equation*
a$						*textobj-latex-a$*
i$						*textobj-latex-i$*
			Text objects for inline math surrounded by dollar
			signs.

						*textobj-latex-single-quote*
aq						*textobj-latex-aq*
iq						*textobj-latex-iq*
			Text objects for single-quoted text `like this'.

						*textobj-latex-double-quote*
aQ						*textobj-latex-aQ*
iQ						*textobj-latex-iQ*
			Text objects for double-quoted text ``like this''.


						*textobj-latex-environment*
ae						*textobj-latex-ae*
ie						*textobj-latex-ie*
			Text objects for LaTeX environments.

			Text objects for environments assume that both the
			\begin{...} and \end{...} delimiters are on lines on
			their own.  By following this simple convention it is
			much easier to support environments that accept
			parameters.

			The leading whitespace of the first line after
			\begin{...} is not included in the "ie" text object.
			This allows to retain the indentation when deleting or
			changing the content of the environment.
			For example, if '█' represents the position of the
			cursor:
